## ripeness

This repo is a web app that explores the readiness of a stock symbol for entry or exit based on a selection of setups.

Start the ripeMain.py app as follows:
```
For Windows:
>set FLASK_APP=ripeMain
>flask run

For all other systems:
FLASK_APP=ripeMain.py flask run
```

After you issue the above command you can now put the following url into your web browser to test the app:
http://127.0.0.1/hello
This is the "Hello World" page for this app.

<b>After Hello World</b> its time to do something more interesting.
